## 1. Project Background

Systematic reviews and network meta-analyses are cornerstones of evidence-based medicine. However, their production is resource-intensive, with the Risk of Bias (RoB) assessment phase—evaluating the methodological quality of included studies—being particularly labor-intensive and prone to subjectivity.

The SmartEBM Risk of Bias Assessment Tool addresses these challenges through advanced integration with the ROBUST-RCT framework, achieving 97.5% accuracy for high-confidence assessments across 3,276 evaluations in the SmartNMA research validation. The tool employs innovative two-step decomposition methodology that breaks down complex bias assessment into manageable components, combined with confidence-based classification that automatically identifies which assessments can be trusted versus those requiring manual review.

### ROBUST-RCT Framework Integration

The ROBUST-RCT (Risk Of Bias Using Structured Thinking - Randomized Controlled Trials) framework provides a systematic approach to bias assessment that our tool implements through:

**Two-Step Decomposition Process:**
1. **Domain Analysis**: Each bias domain (randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, etc.) is evaluated independently with domain-specific prompts and criteria
2. **Synthesis Integration**: Individual domain assessments are synthesized into overall study-level bias evaluation with confidence scoring

**Confidence-Based Classification:**
- **High Confidence (97.5% accuracy)**: Clear evidence and consistent LLM agreement across domains
- **Medium Confidence**: Minor discrepancies requiring targeted review
- **Low Confidence**: Significant conflicts or insufficient information requiring manual assessment

This approach enables researchers to focus their limited time on genuinely uncertain cases while trusting automated assessments for clear-cut evaluations.

### The SmartEBM Agent Ecosystem

While this repository focuses on the RoB Assessment Agent, it is part of a larger ecosystem of intelligent agents being developed by our team, which also includes:

- **Title and Abstract Screening Agent**: Automates initial literature screening.
- **Full-Text Screening Agent**: Screens full-text articles for final inclusion.
- **Data Extraction Agent**: Extracts PICOS data, study characteristics, and outcomes from included studies.
- **Data Analysis Agent**: Performs statistical calculations for network meta-analysis.
- **Certainty of Evidence (CoE) Assessment Agent**: Assists in rating the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

This modular design allows for a flexible and powerful end-to-end solution for evidence synthesis.

## 4. ROBUST-RCT Framework and Assessment Workflow

### 4.1 ROBUST-RCT Integration Overview

The SmartEBM Risk of Bias Assessment Tool implements the ROBUST-RCT framework through a sophisticated two-step decomposition process that ensures systematic and reliable bias evaluation:

#### **Step 1: Domain-Specific Assessment**
Each bias domain is evaluated independently using specialized prompts and criteria:

1. **Random Sequence Generation**: Assessment of randomization method adequacy
2. **Allocation Concealment**: Evaluation of allocation sequence concealment
3. **Blinding of Participants and Personnel**: Assessment of performance bias risk
4. **Blinding of Outcome Assessment**: Evaluation of detection bias risk
5. **Incomplete Outcome Data**: Assessment of attrition bias handling
6. **Selective Reporting**: Evaluation of reporting bias risk
7. **Other Bias**: Assessment of additional bias sources

#### **Step 2: Synthesis and Confidence Scoring**
Individual domain assessments are synthesized with confidence classification:

- **High Confidence (97.5% accuracy)**: Clear evidence, consistent LLM agreement, definitive bias determination
- **Medium Confidence**: Minor discrepancies between LLMs, generally clear evidence with minor uncertainties
- **Low Confidence**: Major conflicts between LLMs, insufficient information, or ambiguous evidence requiring manual review

### 4.2 Assessment Workflow Process

#### **Pre-Assessment Phase**
1. **Document Processing**: PDF text extraction with OCR fallback for scanned documents
2. **Content Validation**: Verification of study type and methodological information availability
3. **Batch Organization**: Intelligent grouping for parallel processing optimization

#### **Assessment Execution**
1. **Domain Analysis**: Sequential evaluation of each ROBUST-RCT domain with specialized prompts
2. **Cross-Validation**: Multiple LLM assessment with agreement analysis
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Automatic classification based on evidence clarity and LLM consensus
4. **Quality Flagging**: Identification of assessments requiring manual review

#### **Post-Assessment Processing**
1. **Result Synthesis**: Integration of domain-specific assessments into overall bias evaluation
2. **Report Generation**: Creation of detailed Excel and HTML reports with confidence indicators
3. **Quality Assurance**: Flagging of low-confidence assessments for manual review

## 8. Troubleshooting

### 8.1 Common Issues

**Installation Problems:**
```bash
# Python version issues
python --version  # Should be 3.8+

# Dependency conflicts
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall

# Permission errors (Linux/macOS)
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /path/to/tool
```

**Configuration Errors:**
- **Invalid API Keys**: Verify keys are active and have sufficient quota
- **Path Issues**: Use absolute paths or ensure relative paths are correct
- **Model Availability**: Check if specified models are accessible
- **Resource Limits**: Reduce worker count if system resources are insufficient

**Runtime Issues:**
```bash
# Memory errors
# Reduce parallel workers or batch size in config

# Network timeouts
# Increase timeout values in LLM configuration

# Disk space issues
# Clean temporary files: python main.py cleanup
```

### 8.2 Performance Issues

**Slow Processing:**
- Increase parallel workers (within system limits)
- Reduce document text length limits
- Use faster LLM models
- Optimize batch sizes

**High Costs:**
- Enable cost tracking and alerts
- Use smaller/cheaper models for initial assessment
- Implement text preprocessing to reduce token usage
- Review and optimize prompts

**Memory Issues:**
- Reduce parallel workers
- Decrease batch sizes
- Enable memory limits in configuration
- Process documents in smaller chunks

### 8.3 Bias Assessment Specific Issues

**Low Confidence Assessments:**
- **Insufficient Study Information**: Ensure PDFs contain complete methodology sections
- **Ambiguous Reporting**: Consider manual review for studies with unclear methodological descriptions
- **LLM Disagreement**: Review domain-specific assessments to identify sources of conflict
- **Language Barriers**: Verify text extraction quality for non-English studies

**Domain-Specific Challenges:**
```bash
# Randomization Assessment Issues
# Check for explicit randomization method descriptions
# Verify sequence generation details are present

# Allocation Concealment Problems  
# Look for concealment method descriptions
# Ensure allocation timing information is available

# Blinding Assessment Difficulties
# Verify participant and outcome assessor blinding descriptions
# Check for open-label study justifications
```

**Quality Assurance Recommendations:**
- **Mandatory Review**: All low-confidence assessments (typically 10-15% of studies)
- **Spot Checking**: Random sample of high-confidence results (recommended 10-20%)
- **Domain Focus**: Extra attention to domains with frequent conflicts (often blinding and allocation concealment)
- **Inter-rater Reliability**: Periodic validation against manual assessments

**Assessment Accuracy Optimization:**
```json
{
  "quality_control": {
    "confidence_thresholds": {
      "high_confidence_minimum": 0.85,
      "manual_review_maximum": 0.60
    },
    "domain_weights": {
      "randomization": 1.0,
      "allocation_concealment": 1.0,
      "blinding": 0.8
    }
  }
}
```
