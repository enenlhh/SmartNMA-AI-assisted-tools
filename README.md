## Performance and Scalability

### Multi-Threaded Parallel Processing Architecture

SmartEBM's core advantage lies in its **intelligent parallel processing design**, which fundamentally transforms systematic review efficiency by processing multiple records simultaneously rather than sequentially. This architecture enables:

**Parallel Processing Capabilities**:
- **Concurrent Record Processing**: Simultaneously processes 10-50+ records/studies depending on hardware
- **Intelligent Load Distribution**: Automatically divides large datasets into optimal batch sizes
- **Scalable Thread Management**: Adapts to available CPU cores and memory resources
- **API Rate Optimization**: Maximizes throughput within LLM provider rate limits

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Batch Processing**: Large datasets divided into manageable subsets for parallel execution
- **Result Aggregation**: Seamless combination of parallel processing results
- **Error Isolation**: Individual thread failures don't affect overall workflow completion
- **Resource Management**: Dynamic allocation based on system capabilities

This parallel architecture is what enables SmartEBM to complete systematic reviews in hours rather than weeks, making AI-assisted evidence synthesis practical for real-world research timelines.

### Efficiency Improvements by Workflow Phase

#### Time and Resource Consumption Analysis

| Module | Configuration Time | Generation Time* | Manual Verification | Total Time | Prompt Tokens | Completion Tokens | Total Tokens |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------|---------------|------------------|--------------|
| Title-Abstract Screening | 4.0 hours | 2.2 hours | 2.5 hours | 8.7 hours | 30,200,000 | 3,080,000 | 33,280,000 |
| Full-Text Screening | 1.0 hour | 0.2 hours | 1.5 hours | 2.7 hours | 8,688,000 | 322,800 | 9,010,800 |
| Data Extraction | 0.5 hours | 0.6 hours | 14.3 hours | 15.4 hours | 11,033,400 | 1,790,600 | 12,824,000 |
| RoB Assessment | 0.5 hours | 0.1 hours | 1.8 hours | 2.4 hours | 1,781,000 | 467,200 | 2,248,200 |
| Data Analysis | 0.1 hours | <0.1 minutes | <0.1 minutes | <0.2 hours | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| CoE Assessment | 0.1 hours | <0.1 minutes | <0.1 minutes | <0.2 hours | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Total Framework** | **6.2 hours** | **~3 hours** | **~20 hours** | **~30 hours** | **51,702,400** | **5,660,600** | **57,363,000** |

*RoB: risk of bias; CoE: certainty of evidence.*

**† Assumed scenario**: 10,000 title-abstract records, 300 full-text records, 100 included studies, and 5 outcomes for algorithmic modules.

**\* Calculated based on using 10 threads** (e.g., dividing 10,000 title-abstract records into 10 subsets of 1,000 records for parallel processing), which processes all subsets simultaneously, effectively reducing the total time to that required for processing just 1,000 records.

**Cost calculations based on total token consumption of 57,363,000 tokens** (51,702,400 prompt tokens and 5,660,600 completion tokens) for a typical NMA with 10,000 title-abstract screening records, 300 full-text screening records, and 100 included studies.

#### Module-Specific Token Consumption

**Token Calculation**: Based on empirical consumption rates: title-abstract screening (1,664 tokens/record × 2 instances × 10,000 records), full-text screening (15,018 tokens/record × 2 instances × 300 records), data extraction (64,120 tokens/study × 2 instances × 100 studies), RoB assessment (11,241 tokens/study × 2 instances × 100 studies).

- **Title-Abstract Screening**: 33,280,000 tokens (30,200,000 prompt + 3,080,000 completion)
- **Full-Text Screening**: 9,010,800 tokens (8,688,000 prompt + 322,800 completion)  
- **Data Extraction**: 12,824,000 tokens (11,033,400 prompt + 1,790,600 completion)
- **RoB Assessment**: 2,248,200 tokens (1,781,000 prompt + 467,200 completion)

#### Parallel Processing Efficiency

The SmartEBM framework's key advantage lies in its **multi-threaded parallel processing architecture**, which enables simultaneous processing of multiple records/studies rather than sequential processing. This parallel approach reduces generation time from theoretical sequential processing of 4,773 minutes to just 286 minutes - a **16.7x improvement in processing speed**.

**Parallel Processing Benefits**:
- **Scalable Thread Management**: Supports 10-50+ parallel threads depending on hardware capabilities
- **Simultaneous Record Processing**: Processes multiple screening records, extractions, or assessments concurrently
- **Hardware-Optimized Performance**: Automatically scales to available CPU cores and memory
- **Reduced Wall-Clock Time**: Total framework completion time of ~30 hours represents substantial efficiency improvements over traditional approaches

The efficiency gains are achieved through intelligent workload distribution, where large datasets are automatically divided into smaller subsets for parallel processing, with results aggregated upon completion. Implementation costs vary significantly across different LLM models, ranging from $29.74 (GPT-4 mini) to $288.02 (Claude-3.5 Sonnet) for a typical systematic review scenario.
